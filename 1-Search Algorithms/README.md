# ASSIGNMENT 1: Search Algorithms
## Submitted by: Huzefa Shabbir Hussain Kagalwala

The `search.py` file contains three functions to implement:
1. Depth First Search
2. Uniform Cost Search
3. A*

**Note:** If you change line 205 to `open_set = Queue()`, the *depth_first_search()* function starts behaving like a Breadth First Search algorithm, as both are the same except for their implementation of their open lists.

### Depth First Search:

### Uniform Cost Search:

### A*:

## Instructions:
1. Copy the `utils` folder too, as it contains the code for the search visualization.
2. Run the `search.py` file to get the results shown here.
